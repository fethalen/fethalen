# Hello, I'm Felix 👋🏻

I'm a Ph.D. student working at [the Department for Animal Evolution and Biodiversity](https://github.com/Animal-Evolution-and-Biodiversity) in Göttingen, Germany. I write software used in phylogenomic studies and am especially interested in animal evolution. For my PhD project, I'm reconstructing a phylogeny for the animal family Nereididae (Annelida), a lineage comprising over 700 described species.

These are the programming languages that I write in most often:
