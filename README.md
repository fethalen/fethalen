# Hello, I'm Felix 👋🏻

I'm a bioinformatician and develop software used in phylogenomics research. I am doing my PhD at the 
Department for Animal Evolution and Biodiversity at the University of Göttingen.
The goal of my project is to generate a phylogeny for the animal family Nereididae (Annelida), comprising
over 700 described species. You can read more about my research at [the department's website](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/a+phylogenomic+analysis+of+nereididae+%28annelida%29/630219.html).

These are the programming languages that I write in most often:

### Highlighted Work

- [PhyloPyPruner](https://gitlab.com/fethalen/phylopypruner) — Tree-based orthology inference with decontamination filters and elaborate statistics
- [Patchwork](https://github.com/fethalen/Patchwork) — Stitches patchy sequence fragments together based on a local alignment search (under construction 🚧)
- [Better FASTA Grep](https://github.com/fethalen/better_fasta_grep) — Grep-like tool for searching and retrieving sequence records

### Languages

- I am fluent in English 🇬🇧
- Ich spreche ein bisschen Deutsch 🇩🇪
- Svenska 🇸🇪 är mitt modersmål
