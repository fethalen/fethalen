# Hello, I'm Felix 👋🏻

I'm a PhD student at [the International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Genome Science](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/556628.html), working at
[the Department for Animal Evolution and Biodiversity](https://github.com/Animal-Evolution-and-Biodiversity)
in Göttingen, Germany. I develop software used for phylogenomics research and am especially interested in the evolution of animals.
In my research, I am constructing a phylogeny for the animal family Nereididae (Annelida), a group comprising
over 700 described species. You can read more about my research at [my department's website](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/a+phylogenomic+analysis+of+nereididae+%28annelida%29/630219.html).

These are the programming languages that I write in most often:

### Highlighted Work

- [PhyloPyPruner](https://gitlab.com/fethalen/phylopypruner) — Tree-based orthology inference with decontamination filters and elaborate statistics
- [Patchwork](https://github.com/fethalen/Patchwork) — Stitches patchy sequence fragments together based on a local alignment search (under construction 🚧)
- [Better FASTA Grep](https://github.com/fethalen/better_fasta_grep) — Grep-like tool for searching and retrieving sequence records

### Languages

- I am fluent in English 🇬🇧
- Ich spreche ein bisschen Deutsch 🇩🇪
- Svenska 🇸🇪 är mitt modersmål
