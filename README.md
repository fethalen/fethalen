# Hello, I'm Felix 👋🏻

I'm a PhD student in The International Max Planck Research School for Genome Science (IMPRS-GS)
at the University of Göttingen, Germany. My research interests center around the development 
of novel methods for assisting in large-scale phylogenetic studies. I enjoy data analysis
as well as software development, and some of the tools that I've developed are presented here.

### Projects

- [Patchwork](https://github.com/fethalen/Patchwork) — A reference- and alignment-based program for mining phylogenetic markers from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data
- [PhyloPyPruner](https://github.com/fethalen/phylopypruner) — Tree-based orthology inference with decontamination filters and elaborate statistics
- [Eukaryotic genome assembly (EGA)](https://github.com/ThiloSchulze/eukaryotic-genome-assembly) — Pipeline for assembling and evaluating short-read Illumina gDNA data of eukaryotic origin
- [Better FASTA Grep](https://github.com/fethalen/better_fasta_grep) — Grep-like tool for searching and retrieving sequence records

### Languages

- English (fluent)
- Swedish (native)
