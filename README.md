# Hello, I'm Felix 👋🏻

I'm a Bioinformatician at Cardio-CARE Davos in Switzerland.
My research interests center around the development of novel methods for assisting in large-scale 
phylogenetic studies but my interests within bioinformatics are broad. Here are some of the
tools that I've developed over the years.

### Projects

- [Patchwork](https://github.com/fethalen/Patchwork) — An alignment-based program for mining phylogenetic markers from whole-genome sequencing data
- [PhyloPyPruner](https://github.com/fethalen/phylopypruner) — Tree-based orthology inference with decontamination filters and elaborate statistics
- [Better FASTA Grep](https://github.com/fethalen/better_fasta_grep) — Grep-like tool for searching and retrieving sequence records

### Frequently used programming languages
