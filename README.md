<h2 align="center">Hi there, I'm Felicia. 👋</h2>

I work as a Bioinformatician at Cardio-CARE in Davos, Switzerland. 
Our research is centered on the genomics of cardiovascular disease, although my background is in animal evolution.
Among other things, I am one of the main contributors to the GWAS pipeline used internally by our company.
I have an interest in programming languages and greatly value reproducibility in both research and scientific software.
